## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install XAMPP

Download and install XAMPP.

### 2️⃣ Start Apache and MySQL

Open **XAMPP Control Panel** → click **Start** for both **Apache** and **MySQL**.

### 3️⃣ Import the Database

1. Open [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost/phpmyadmin).
2. Create a new database, e.g., `articles_db`.
3. Import the `articles.sql` file from this repository.

### 4️⃣ Configure Database

1. Copy `config.php` to `db.php`.
2. Open `db.php` and replace placeholders with your database credentials:

```php
$host = "localhost";
$user = "your_db_username";
$password = "your_db_password";
$dbname = "articles_db";
```

### 5️⃣ Move Project Files

Copy the project folder into your XAMPP `htdocs` directory:

```
C:\xampp\htdocs\article-manager
```

### 6️⃣ Run the Project

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost/article-manager/
```

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

> Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username.

✅ With this setup, your repository is **safe, clean, and ready for sharing**.

If you want, I can **also create the `config.example.php` and LICENSE file content** so you can drop them into your project immediately and push to GitHub safely.

Do you want me to do that next?
